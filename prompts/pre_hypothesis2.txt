You'll be given two lists of words, list of related words and list of unrelated words. They may or may not be empty ([] means empty). Your task is to guess a topic such that the related words are related to the topics, while the unrelated words are not related to the topics. Here are two examples:

Example 1:
Related words: ['knife']
Unrelated words: []
Topic: Weapons that could be used to hunt animals

Example 2:
Related words: ['knife']
Unrelated words: ['bows', 'guns']
Topic: Cooking tools

Now it's your turn, the related words and unrelated words are as follows:
